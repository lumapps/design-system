        required: false
    pattern:
        description: |
            RexExp pattern to match.
            This can only match on the beginning of a line in the PR body
        required: true
    replace:
        description: |
            String to replace the pattern.
            Can contain capture groups (`$1` to insert the first capture from the regexp pattern)
        required: true
    keepLastMatch:
        description: |
            Set to true to keep only the last match of the pattern and remove the others.
    whenNotFound:
        description: |
            Change behavior when the pattern is not found.
            Set to "append" to append the replace string to the end.
            Set to "ignore" to skip.
            Else an error is thrown.
    skipReplaceIf:
        description: |
            Skip replace if this expression returns true.
            This can be used to check a match before replacing it.

            => Will skip replacing the match if the first capture group is 'foo'.
