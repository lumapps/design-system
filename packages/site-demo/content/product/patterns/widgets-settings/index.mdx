# Widgets settings pattern - Tab Contents

**All widgets share a common organization in terms of contents settings and style settings. This pattern focuses on the tab “Contents”.**

<span class="lumx-color-font-red-D2"><i>Disclaimer: while the new DS is not implemented, some examples might seem uncorrect due to various spacings included in some components.</i></span>

## Anatomy

The “Contents” tab regroups all the settings linked to the items displayed by the widget. They answer the question **“What is displayed?”**.
The “Style” tab regroups all the settings that apply to the design of the widget. They answer the question **“How it is displayed?”**.

The “Contents” tab is divided into 4 sections: Widget Body, Widget Header, Widget Footer and Advanced.

## Heading and spacing rules

### The rule

### Example

<img src="assets/heading-spacing-example.png" width="100%" />

## Full view

<img src="assets/full-view.png" width="100%" />

We use an expansion panel for each section.

By default, during creation, only the section Widget Body is expanded. The other are collapsed. In edition, all sections are collapsed. 

Only one expansion panel can be opened at the same time. If a second expansion panel is openned, the first one is automatically closed.

Between each expansion panel, a divider is used.

## Sections

## Default behavior

When default behavior are defined for a setting, the values are visible to the user.
 *i.e. post types or excerpt truncation*

 ## Switchs versus checkboxes

 <img src="assets/switch-checkboxe.png"/>

 If a settings impact in real time the widget, the component used is a switch.
 *i.e.information displayed in a post*

 ## Main and sub settings

  <img src="assets/main-sub-settings.png"/>

If a settings depends on the activation of another setting, the sub setting is always display close to the main setting as defined in the spacing rule.
