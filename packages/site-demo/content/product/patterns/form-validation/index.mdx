# Form validation

**Use form validations to give feedbacks about invalid users inputs and reduce risks of confusion.**

Validation requirements **must be stated upfront**, live feedbacks are strongly suggested. Users mustn't be left guessing.

A validation can occur for example when:

-   The datatype isn’t correct.
-   The entered data has too many or not enough characters.
-   No data has been entered in a required field.

## Visualization

Colors scheme :

-   <Text as="span" color="red-N" typography="subtitle1">Red/N</Text> for errors
-   <Text as="span" color="yellow-D2" typography="subtitle1">Yellow/D2</Text> for warnings
-   <Text as="span" color="green-N" typography="subtitle1">Green/N</Text> for success
-   <Text as="span" color="dark-N" typography="subtitle1">Dark/N</Text> for helpers

## Error state

<img src="assets/error-state.png" width="100%" />

Use error messages to help users understand the issue and how to fix it. Error messages are emphasized with :

-   The label in <Text as="span" color="red-N" typography="subtitle1">Red/N</Text>
-   The field borders in <Text as="span" color="red-N" typography="subtitle1">Red/N</Text>
-   The material design icon “alert-circle” within the field in <Text as="span" color="red-N" typography="subtitle1">Red/N</Text>
-   The error message in <Text as="span" color="red-N" typography="subtitle1">Red/N</Text>, under the field

## Success state

<img src="assets/success-state.png" width="100%" />

Use success messages to confirm users inputs validation. Success messages are not mandatory.
Success messages are emphasized with :

-   The label in <Text as="span" color="green-N" typography="subtitle1">Green/N</Text>
-   The field borders in <Text as="span" color="green-N" typography="subtitle1">Green/N</Text>
-   The material design icon “check-circle” within the field in <Text as="span" color="green-N" typography="subtitle1">Green/N</Text>

## Helpers

<img src="assets/helpers.png" width="100%" />

Use helper messages to provide guidance. \
Helper messages are not mandatory. \
Helper messages are emphasized with the helper message in <Text as="span" color="dark-L2" typography="subtitle1">Dark/L2/N</Text>, under the field.

## Submit button behavior

<img src="assets/submit-behavior1.png" width="100%" />

By default, the submit button is disabled as long as the mandatory fields haven’t been completed, or present errors.

<img src="assets/submit-behavior2.png" width="100%" />

The submit button is enabled when all the mandatory fields have been completed, and do not present errors.

## Validation feedback

<img src="assets/validation1.png" width="100%" />

<img src="assets/validation2.png" width="100%" />

The validation feedback should be triggered when the user has clicked away from the text field, and only if the user has ever typed something in the field.

## Inline validation

<img src="assets/inline-validation.png" width="100%" />

**Error occurring in a particular field**

Error messages must be displayed inline with erroneous fields. If an error occur in a particular field, show it under this field.

## Stepper buttons behavior

<img src="assets/stepper-behavior1.png" width="100%" />

<img src="assets/stepper-behavior2.png" width="100%" />

The "Next" stepper button is _disabled_ as long as the mandatory fields haven’t been completed or present errors.

<img src="assets/stepper-behavior3.png" width="100%" />

The "Next" stepper button is _enabled_ when all the mandatory fields have been completed and do not present errors.

## Optional vs. mandatory fields

<img src="assets/optional-mandatory.png" width="100%" />

Mandatory fields are marked with a red asterisk at the beginning of the label.

## Error message copy

<img src="assets/error-message.png" width="100%" />

The error message copy below the field should be as informative as possible when describing the issue with the users data. Error messages should clearly state:

-   What happened, ex. : \
    <Text as="span" color="red-N">Sorry, this username has already been taken</Text>
-   What’s the next step the user should take to succeed, ex. : \
    <Text as="span" color="red-N">Please choose another username</Text>

Validation labels should always avoid using technical jargon.

## Submit error state

<img src="assets/submit-error.png" width="100%" />

If the error is general (e.g. a problem with sending data to the server) and there wasn’t a page reload – show the message next to the submit button, if there was a page reload – show it at the top of the page.
