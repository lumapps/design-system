# Filter and sort

**Use filter and sort patterns when users need a way to shrink down a long list of elements in order to find and proceed one or several elements.**

## Anatomy

Filter and sort patterns has three sections: A text filter, trigger filters, and a sorting selector. Every zone combine and is optional.

## Text filter

Filter by checking if the entered text matches one of the text values of list elements. Elements values checked are to defined accordingly to needs. Clearing the text filter input remove the filter.

## Exposed choices

By default and when there is space, expose choices directly to users.

<DemoBlock demo="choices" />

## Exposed facets

If space is constrained or there are too much choices to display, only expose facets.

<DemoBlock demo="facets" />

## Full collapsed

If space is really constrained or trigger filters are only secondary in users scenario, they can be collapsed in one chip that open a popover. In the popover, only a handful of choices is exposed for each filter, clicking the "Show more" link reveal the others.

<!-- ## Responsive behaviors

### Exposed choices

When choices are exposed and the space come to be not enough to show them all on the same line then choices are not exposed anymore, instead the facet is.

### Exposed facets

When facets are exposed and the space come to be not enough to show them all on the same line they collapses. The lasts facets on the line collapses with the one next to it. As space reduces (when users resize their browser windows for example) each facet that doesn't fit collapses.

### Extreme low width version

In case of extreme low width, trigger filters and sorting selector may be turned to simple icon buttons.

## Sorting

Sorting is a simple [select](/product/components/select/) component. Each sorting option is a select option, even for handling ascending and descending orders. Use words like "most recent", "most relevant", "least recent" to help users rapidly find the sorting they want.
