# Filter and sort

**Use filter and sort patterns when users need a way to shrink down a long list of elements in order to find and proceed one or several elements.**

## Anatomy

Filter and sort patterns has three sections: A text filter, trigger filters, and a sorting selector. Every zone combine and is optional.

## Text filter

Filter by checking if the entered text matches one of the text values of list elements. Elements values checked are to defined accordingly to needs. Clearing the text filter input remove the filter. Checks are delayed for 500ms to prevent filtering on each keystroke.

## Exposed choices

By default and when there is space, expose choices directly to users.

<DemoBlock demo="choices" />

## Exposed facets

If space is constrained or there are too much choices to display, only expose facets.

<DemoBlock demo="facets" />

## Full collapsed

If space is really constrained or trigger filters are only secondary in users scenario, they can be collapsed in one chip that open a popover. In the popover, only a handful of choices is exposed for each filter, clicking the "Show more" link reveal the others.

## Responsive

As space reduces (when users resize their browser window for example) each element that doesn't fit go to the line.

## Vertical variant

Vertical variant can be used when the page layout make it difficult to use the original horizontal layout.

## Sorting

Each sorting option is an option, even for handling ascending and descending orders. Use words like "most recent", "most relevant", "least recent" to help users rapidly find the sorting they want.
