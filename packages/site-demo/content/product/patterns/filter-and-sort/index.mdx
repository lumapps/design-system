# Filter and sort

**Use filter and sort patterns when users need a way to shrink down a long list of elements in order to find and proceed one or several elements.**

## Anatomy

Filter and sort patterns have three sections: A text filter, trigger filters, and a sorting selector. Sections are optional and combine.

## Text filter

Filter by checking if the entered text matches one of the text values of list elements. Define elements' values checked according to needs. Clearing the text filter input remove the filter. Checks are delayed for 500ms to prevent filtering on each keystroke.

## Trigger filters

### Exposed choices

By default and when there is space, expose choices directly to users.

<DemoBlock demo="choices" />

### Exposed facets

When space is a constraint or there are too much choices to display, only expose facets.

### Grouped

When space is really a constraint or trigger filters are only secondary in users scenario, they can be grouped in one single filter chip.

## Sorting selector

Each sorting option is an option, even for handling ascending and descending orders. Use words like "most recent", "most relevant", "least recent" to help users rapidly find the sorting they want.

## Layout behavior

### Responsive

As space reduces (when users resize their browser window for example) each section that doesn't fit go to new line. Inside each section elements behave the same way.

### Vertical variant

When pages layout make it difficult to use the original horizontal layout use vertical variant.
