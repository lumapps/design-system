# Filter and sort

**Use filter and sort patterns when users need a way to shrink down a long list of elements in order to find and proceed one or several elements.**

## Anatomy

Filter and sort patterns have three sections: A search field, facets or filter button, and a sorter. Sections are optional and combine.
