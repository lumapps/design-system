# Filter and sort

**Use filter and sort patterns when users need a way to shrink down a long list of elements in order to find and proceed one or several elements.**

## Anatomy

Filter and sort patterns have three sections: A search field, facets or filter button, and a sorter. Sections are optional and combine.

Two configuration are possible for filters:

-   Exposed facets
-   Filters button

## Exposed facets

Use exposed facets when the list of items can be filtered on a very few criteria.

## Filter button

Use the filter button when there are a lot of filtering criteria for a list of items.

## Sorting

Each sorting option is an option, even for handling ascending and descending orders. Use words like “most recent”, “most relevant”, “least recent” to help users rapidly find the sorting they want.
