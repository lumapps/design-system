# Typography

**Use typography to create clear visual hierarchies, organize information, and guide users.**

## Typefaces

The design system intentionally uses default systems fonts, avoiding unnecessary weight, loading time plus benefiting native system fonts accessibility.

### Fonts by system

<table style={{ textAlign: 'left', width: '100%' }}>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>System</th>
            <th>Font</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Windows</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Segoe UI</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Mac OSX</strong>
            </td>
            <td>SF Pro</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Linux</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Ubuntu</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Chrome OS</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Roboto</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Styles

Selecting appropriate text styles is determined by layout structure. Layouts may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies. Using the right text styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful, simple, and effective.

### Basic styles

Basic text styles are default choice for any piece of UI. They are consistent throughout the whole interface and cannot be customized further than the font family choice.

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: ReactDemo1, vue: VueDemo1 }} />

### Custom styles

Custom text styles are overridable by customization:

-   font-family
-   size
-   weight
-   style
-   line-height

Use them in pieces of UI that need to reflect an identity (usually widgets or pages). They’re the same app-wide by default but the customization can be made with context: targeting a specific piece of UI like a specific widget in a specific page.

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: ReactDemo2, vue: VueDemo2 }} />
