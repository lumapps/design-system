# Typography

**Use typography to create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users.**

## Typefaces

The design system uses the open-source typeface Roboto. It can be accessed and downloaded from this <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto" target="_blank">Google font page</a>.

## Styles

Selecting the appropriate type style is determined by layout or template structure. Layouts may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies. Using the right type styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful, simple, and effective.
