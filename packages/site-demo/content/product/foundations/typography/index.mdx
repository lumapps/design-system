# Typography

**Use typography to create clear visual hierarchies, organize information, and guide users.**

## Typefaces

The default font vary with the theme used.

-   With Material theme the design system uses the open-source typeface Roboto. It can be accessed and downloaded from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google font</a>.
-   Without Material theme, the design system intentionaly uses default systems fonts, avoiding unecessary weight, loading time plus benefiting native system fonts accessibility.

### Fonts by system

<table style={{ textAlign: 'left', width: '100%' }}>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>System</th>
            <th>Font</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Windows</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Segoe UI</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

## Styles

Selecting appropriate text styles is determined by layout structure. Layouts may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies. Using the right text styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful, simple, and effective.

### Basic styles

Basic text styles are default choice for any piece of UI. They are consistent throughout the whole interface and cannot be customized further than the font family choice.

    <h1 className="lumx-typography-display1">Display 1</h1>
    <h2 className="lumx-typography-headline">Headline</h2>
    <h3 className="lumx-typography-title">Title</h3>
    <h4 className="lumx-typography-subtitle2">Subtitle 2 dream of the mind's eye star stuff harvesting star</h4>
    <h5 className="lumx-typography-subtitle1">Subtitle 1 finite but unbounded the ash of stellar alchemy</h5>
    <p className="lumx-typography-body2">
        Body 2 Hundreds of thousands with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence billions upon billions
        culture science from which we spring? The only home we've ever known with pretty stories for which there's

### Custom styles

Custom styles are only available when Material theme is not used.
Custom text styles are overrideable by customization:

-   font-family
-   size
-   weight
-   style
-   line-height

Use them in pieces of UI that need to reflect an identity (usually widgets or pages). They’re the same app-wide by default but the customization can be made with context: targeting a specific piece of UI like a specific widget in a specific page.
