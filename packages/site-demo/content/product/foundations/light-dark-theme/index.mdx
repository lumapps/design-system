# Light & Dark Theme

By default, all component use a `light` theme that works on light-colored backgrounds.\
**Some components** provide an alternative `dark` theme that can be used to adapt to dark backgrounds.

This theme is not synced to the user's preferred color scheme, it **must be activated manually**.

## Activate via prop

On the supported components, use the `theme` prop to activate the desired theme.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher theme="dark" alwaysShowCode demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Activate via context

Use the `ThemeProvider` component to apply the desired theme to all descendants that supports it.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher theme="dark" alwaysShowCode demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

Please note **some exceptions** to the theme context propagation:

-   The components `Popover`, `Lightbox` and `Dialog` all ignore the parent theme context and reset the theme because their children won't appear on the same background from where they are called
-   However, the `Popover` takes the given `theme` props and propagates to its items via the context

Use the `useTheme()` hook to get the theme from the current theme context when you need to adapt within your custom component.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher theme="dark" alwaysShowCode demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />
