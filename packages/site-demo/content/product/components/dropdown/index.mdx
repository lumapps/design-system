# Dropdown

**Dropdowns present multiple actions in a small area.**
Dropdowns are commonly used for contextual menus and in form selects.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="default" />

## Programmatically controlled

Dropdowns can be controlled from external events.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo="target" />

## Actions states

Presented actions have various states, they behave like [`clickable list`](/product/components/list/)

<DemoBlock demo="selects" backgroundColor={{ color: 'dark', variant: 'L6' }} vAlign="center" />

### Accessibility concerns

Dropdowns are essentially a wrapper around Popover intended to be used either as a disclosure or a popup (containing a menu or a listbox).
See the [Popover accessibility concerns](/product/components/popover#accessibility-concerns) documentation for more info on those two use case.

We do not yet provide a simple way to create a full accessible menu or listbox to pair with dropdowns.

On top of the popover, dropdowns provide an "infinite scroll" callback to load more data into the dropdown while the user scrolls. Consider adding [`aria-setsize`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-setsize) and [`aria-posinset`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-posinset) to your dropdown list items so that screen readers can know the size of the list and the position of items in the list.
