# Dropdown

**Dropdowns present multiple actions in a small area.**
Dropdowns are commonly used for contextual menus and in form selects. They can contain dividers, icons, a user picture and a thumbnail.

## Default

By default, dropdowns open right next to the trigger.

<DemoBlock demo="default" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

## Programmatically controlled

Dropdowns can be controlled from external events.

<DemoBlock demo="target" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

### Properties

<PropTable component="Dropdown" />
