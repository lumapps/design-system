### Accessibility concerns

Expansion panels use a `section` landmark combined with a disclosure button (see [WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/)).

Make sure the toggle button an appropriate label (defined in the `toggleButtonProps`) so that screen readers can clearly announce what the expansion panel shows once expanded.
