# Expansion panel

**Expansion panels implement large amounts of content in a small space through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">progressive disclosure</a>.**

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Drag handle

A drag handle can be added.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

## Trimmed

Use trimmed when you don't need the left and right spacing.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

## Examples

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: Demo4 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Expansion panels use a `section` landmark combined with a disclosure button (see [WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/)).

Make sure the toggle button an appropriate label (defined in the `toggleButtonProps`) so that screen readers can clearly announce what the expansion panel shows once expanded.
