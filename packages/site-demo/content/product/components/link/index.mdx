# Link

**Display simple hyperlinks**
By default, links are in primary color. They can have an optional icon.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Styles and sizes

Use text styles and icon sizes so that the icon height doesnâ€™t exceed the text line height.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="sizes" withThemeSwitcher />

## Implicit

Links can also be more subtle and appear as normal text (ex: articles titles, user name in [user-block](../user-block))

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="implicit" withThemeSwitcher />

### Properties

<PropTable component="Link" />
