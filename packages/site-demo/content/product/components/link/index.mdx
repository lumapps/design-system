# Link <ReactStabilityFlag status="unstable" />

**Display simple hyperlinks**

By default, links are in primary color. They can have an optional icon.

<DemoBlock demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Styles and sizes

Use text styles and icon sizes so that the icon height doesnâ€™t exceed the text line height.

<DemoBlock demo="sizes" withThemeSwitcher />

## Implicit

Links can also be more subtle and appear as normal text (ex: articles titles in contents list widget, User name in [user-block](../user-block))
