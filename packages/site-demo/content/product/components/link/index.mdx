# Link

**Display simple hyperlinks**.
By default, links are in primary color. They can have an optional icon.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Styles and sizes

Use text styles and icon sizes so that the icon height doesnâ€™t exceed the text line height.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="sizes" withThemeSwitcher />

## Implicit

Links can also be more subtle and appear as normal text (ex: articles titles, user name in [user-block](../user-block))

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="implicit" withThemeSwitcher />

### Accessibility concerns

By default, and as expected, links use a real HTML `<a>` link.

But there are two exceptions to this:
- Providing a `onClick` instead of a `href` will transform the link into a button (while keeping the same link style).
- Providing a `linkAs` will use the given component instead (e.g. a react router link), you'll have to make sure this component provides good accessibility.
