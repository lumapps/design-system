# Badge

**Use badges to display counters, rankings, states, status, activities or custom logos.**\
Badges can be placed above avatars.

## Label

Badges with label are often used to display counters or rankings.

```jsx demo orientation="horizontal"
import { Avatar, Badge } from '@lumx/react';

export default () => (
    <>
        <Badge color="red">
            <span>4</span>
        </Badge>

        <Avatar
            image="/demo-assets/persona.png"
            alt="Avatar with label"
            size="m"
            badge={
                <Badge color="red">
                    <span>4</span>
                </Badge>
            }
        />
    </>
);
```

## Icon

Badges with icon are often used to display states, status or activities.

```jsx demo orientation="horizontal"
import { mdiCheck, mdiClose, mdiHeart, mdiStar } from '@lumx/icons';
import { Avatar, Badge, Icon } from '@lumx/react';

export default () => (
    <>
        <Badge color="green">
            <Icon icon={mdiCheck} />
        </Badge>

        <Badge color="red">
            <Icon icon={mdiClose} />
        </Badge>

        <Avatar
            image="/demo-assets/persona.png"
            alt="Avatar with icon"
            size="m"
            badge={
                <Badge color="yellow">
                    <Icon icon={mdiStar} />
                </Badge>
            }
        />

        <Avatar
            image="/demo-assets/persona.png"
            alt="Avatar with icon"
            size="m"
            badge={
                <Badge color="red">
                    <Icon icon={mdiHeart} />
                </Badge>
            }
        />
    </>
);
```

## Thumbnail

Badges with thumbnail are often used to display custom logos images.

```jsx demo orientation="horizontal"
import { Badge, Thumbnail } from '@lumx/react';

export default () => (
    <Badge>
        <Thumbnail alt="Logo" aspectRatio="square" image="/logo.svg" size="xxs" />
    </Badge>
);
```

## Colors

**Blue** badges are often used as an accent visual, **Green** to emphasize success, **Yellow** to emphasize warnings, **Red** to emphasize alerts and **Dark** as a neutral visual.

```jsx demo orientation="horizontal"
import { mdiAccount, mdiAlertCircle, mdiCheck, mdiClose, mdiStar } from '@lumx/icons';
import { Badge, Icon } from '@lumx/react';

export default () => (
    <>
        <Badge color="blue">
            <Icon icon={mdiStar} />
        </Badge>

        <Badge color="green">
            <Icon icon={mdiCheck} />
        </Badge>

        <Badge color="yellow">
            <Icon icon={mdiAlertCircle} />
        </Badge>

        <Badge color="red">
            <Icon icon={mdiClose} />
        </Badge>

        <Badge color="dark">
            <Icon icon={mdiAccount} />
        </Badge>
    </>
);
```

### Accessibility concerns

A badge can contain two types of information:

-   **An icon/image**, if the information given by this icon is not given by another element next to the badged item,
    then you have to add an alt on the icon to explicit what it means.
    (Ex: a badge icon telling the user is an admin, the alt could be "This user is an administrator" ).
    If the information is already available as a text near the badged element, then you don't have to repeat the
    information. Leave the icon's `alt` empty.
-   **A number**, if the information given by this icon is not given by another element next to the badged item,
    then you have to wrap your number in a span with a `aria-hidden=true` attribute and add a `aria-label` on the badge that
    gives the information.
    (Ex: a badge number counting the number of unread notifications, the aria-label could be "You have X unread notifications").
    If the information is already available as a text near the badged element, then you don't have to repeat the
    information. Keep the number wrapped in `aria-hidden=true` span, and leave no `aria-label` on the Badge component.

Keep in mind that the color can also carry an information, it may be translated for screen-readers through alt texts.
