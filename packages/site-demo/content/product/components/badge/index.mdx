### Accessibility concerns


A badge can contain two types of information:
- **An icon/image**, if the information given by this icon is not given by another element next to the badged item,
then you have to add an alt on the icon to explicit what it means.
(Ex: a badge icon telling the user is an admin, the alt could be "This user is an administrator" ).
If the information is already available as a text near the badged element, then you don't have to repeat the
information. Leave the icon's `alt` empty.
- **A number**, if the information given by this icon is not given by another element next to the badged item,
then you have to wrap your number in a span with a `aria-hidden=true` attribute and add a `aria-label` on the badge that
gives the information.
(Ex: a badge number counting the number of unread notifications, the aria-label could be "You have X unread notifications").
If the information is already available as a text near the badged element, then you don't have to repeat the
information. Keep the number wrapped in `aria-hidden=true` span, and leave no `aria-label` on the Badge component.

Keep in mind that the color can also carry an information, it may be translated for screen-readers through alt texts.
