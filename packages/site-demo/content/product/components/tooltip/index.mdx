# Tooltip

**Tooltips display information when users hover or focus an element.**\
They are positioned using anchor elements.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Placement

Tooltips are positioned at the bottom of the target by default.
Tooltips' position can be forced to one of these options: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.
If there is not enough space to correctly display the tooltip, tooltip will be displayed at the best position.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

## Delay

Tooltips display can be delayed.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Tooltips implement the [WAI-ARIA tooltip role](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/) and are **only accessible via mouse hover or keyboard focus**. As such it should generally be used **only on focusable element**.

Tooltip messages should be concise, directly describing the element that triggered it and should not contain essential information.

By default, the tooltip is linked to the anchor via `aria-describedby`, meaning as a description of the anchor element. Use `ariaLinkMode="aria-labelledby"` to link to the anchor via `aria-labelledby` and thus using the tooltip as the label for the anchor.

Use `closeMode="hide"` to render the tooltip hidden when not activated and keep to more accessible to screen readers. By default `closeMode="unmount"` is used and the tooltip only render when activated.

Consider using the [Popover](/product/components/popover/#accessibility-concerns) as a disclosure element to show longer or richer messages.
