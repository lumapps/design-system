# Thumbnail

**Thumbnails display formatted images.**

## Sizes

Thumbnails come in 7 sizes (width): `xxs`, `xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `xl`, and unset.
Check [size foundations](/product/foundations/size) for more details.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="sizes" />

## Ratios

Thumbnails come in 6 aspect ratios: `free`, `horizontal`, `original`, `square`, `vertical` and `wide`.

- `free`: define width and height as wanted, there is no relation between them.
- `horizontal`: 3:2 (width:height) ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `original`: source image ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `square`: 1:1 ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `vertical`: 2:3 ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `wide`: 16:9 ratio, define width, height is calculated.

*For any ratio except `original` the source image might be cropped.*

## Variants

Thumbnails come in two variants: `squared` and `rounded`

## Loading state

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="loading" withThemeSwitcher />

Thumbnails display a loading state while loading the image if they are configured with sufficient size constraints.
Three type of size constraints can be used:

- using `imgProps={{ width, height }}` to set the original image size (or same original size ratio).
  Thumbnails will scale down if the given `width` and `height` are bigger than allowed space.
- using `fillHeight` to fit the parent height.
- using a fixed ratio (any ratio except `free` and `original`) and a width constraint (using `size` prop or manual CSS).

## Error state

Thumbnails will display an error state by default when the image fails to load correctly.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="error" withThemeSwitcher />

The `fallback` prop can be used to change the icon or even replace the error state with a custom React node.

### Accessibility concerns

Thumbnails may have 5 different accessibility use cases: 
- **Decorative image** if your image is only decorative, there is no essential information in it, you can set can **let the `alt` attribute empty**
(See [the W3C reference page for Decorative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) for more details)
- **Non-decorative image** if your image gives informations, is textual or helps understand better the sibling content, you will **have to 
define an `alt` attribute**. 
In order to find how to fill this attribute, please refer to this [decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
- **Link image** if the `linkProps.href` or `linkAs` is defined, then your image will be wrapped in `<a>` tag. 
You **should define the `alt` attribute**, with a string indicating where the link will take the user.
(See [the W3C reference page for Functional images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/) for more details)
- **Clickable image** if the `onClick` prop is defined, then your image will be wrapped in a button. 
You **should define the `alt` attribute**, with a string indicating the purpose of the button.
(See [the W3C reference page for Functional images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/) for more details)
- **Badged thumbnail** if you have a badge on your Thumbnail, then the badge should handle the accessibility of its informations.
(See the [badge page](../badge#accessibility-concerns) for the accessibility concerns on badged thumbnails.)

If you have some troubles to define how to fill the `alt` attribute, you can use the [Alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
