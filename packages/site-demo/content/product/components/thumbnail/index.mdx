# Thumbnail

**Thumbnails display formatted images.**

## Sizes

Thumbnails come in 7 sizes (width): `xxs`, `xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `xl`, and unset.
Check [size foundations](/product/foundations/size) for more details.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="sizes" />

## Ratios

Thumbnails come in 6 aspect ratios: `free`, `horizontal`, `original`, `square`, `vertical` and `wide`.

- `free`: define width and height as wanted, there is no relation between them.
- `horizontal`: 3:2 (width:height) ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `original`: source image ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `square`: 1:1 ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `vertical`: 2:3 ratio, define width, height is calculated.
- `wide`: 16:9 ratio, define width, height is calculated.

*For any ratio except `original` the source image might be cropped.*

## Loading state

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="loading" withThemeSwitcher />

Thumbnails display a loading state while loading the image if they are configured with sufficient size constraints.
Three type of size constraints can be used:

- using `imgProps={{ width, height }}` to set the original image size (or same original size ratio).
  Thumbnails will scale down if the given `width` and `height` are bigger than allowed space.
- using `fillHeight` to fit the parent height.
- using a fixed ratio (any ratio except `free` and `original`) and a width constraint (using `size` prop or manual CSS).

## Error state

Thumbnails will display an error state by default when the image fails to load correctly.

The `fallback` prop can be used to change the icon or even replace the error state with a custom React node.
