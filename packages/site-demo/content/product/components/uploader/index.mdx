### Accessibility concerns

Uploaders have 2 accessibility use cases:

1. **native file input**: using the `fileInputProps` prop transforms uploaders into a native HTML file input capable of handling file drop.
2. **button** : using the `onClick` prop transforms uploaders into standard button for when you need to use a non-native file picker.

Uploaders can be disabled in two ways:

-   `isDisabled` which completely disables it. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click, etc.) are
    all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the field is here and why it is disabled.
-   `aria-disabled` only disable click and on change (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
    to set up either a tooltip or an aria description to explain to the user why this field is disabled.
