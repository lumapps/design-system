# Text

**Display simple text.**\
By default, text elements have no defined color or typography.

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Color and typography

Both **color** and **typography** can be adapted on text elements (see list of [typography](/product/foundations/typography/) and [color](/product/foundations/color/) styles).

<DemoBlock gap="tiny" demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

<Message kind="info">
    Here "Title" is using <code>Text</code> for demo purpose but the <a href="/product/components/heading">heading</a>{' '}
    element would fit better.
</Message>

## Text wrap and overflow

By default, long texts will wrap on multiple lines. Use `noWrap` to prevent that.
Alternatively, `truncate` can be used to cut with ellipsis (it can also truncate after multiple lines).

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" vAlign="space-evenly" style={{ gap: 90 }} demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Text elements **require** the `as` prop to be filled. Semantic HTML tags should be used as much as possible to ensure screen readers gets the context.

Particularly, on titles, consider using HTML heading tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.). The [heading](/product/components/heading/) element can help you automatically adapt to the current heading level.

When cutting text overflow (with `noWrap` or `truncate`), screen readers will still read everything in text elements so **make sure content is not too long** or cut it beforehand.
