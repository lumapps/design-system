# Switch

**Switches are on/off toggles for a single option.**

<DemoBlock demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

### Accessibility concerns

Switches are based on standard checkbox, implement the [WAI-ARIA `switch` pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/) and are fully accessible if provided with a label. If a helper is provided, it will be used as an additional [description for screen readers](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-describedby).

In contexts where there is no direct label attached to the checkbox, alternative label should be provided with either [`aria-labelledby`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) (preferred) or [`aria-label`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label) (only in last resort) attributes forwarded inside the `inputProps` property.
