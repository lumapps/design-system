# Switch

**Switches are on/off toggles for a single option.**

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Switches are based on standard checkbox, implement the [WAI-ARIA `switch` pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/) and are fully accessible if provided with a label. If a helper is provided, it will be used as an additional [description for screen readers](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-describedby).

In contexts where there is no direct label attached to the checkbox, alternative label should be provided with either [`aria-labelledby`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) (preferred) or [`aria-label`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label) (only in last resort) attributes forwarded inside the `inputProps` property.

Switches can be disabled in two ways:

-   `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the switch. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click,
    etc.) are all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the switch is here and why it
    is disabled.
-   `aria-disabled` only disable changes on the switch (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
    to setup either a `helper`, a tooltip or an aria description to explain to the user why it is disabled.
