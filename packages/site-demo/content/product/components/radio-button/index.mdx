# Radio button

**Radio buttons display exclusive options to chose from.**

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Radio buttons with label are fully accessible by default. If a helper is provided, it will be used as an additional [description for screen readers](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-describedby).

In contexts where there is no direct label attached to the radio button, alternative label should be provided with either [`aria-labelledby`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) (preferred) or [`aria-label`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label) (only in last resort) attributes forwarded inside the `inputProps` property.

Radio button can disabled in two ways:

-   `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the radio button. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click,
    etc.) are all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the radio button is here and
    why it is disabled.
-   `aria-disabled` only disable changes on the radio button (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll
    have to setup either a `helper`, a tooltip or an aria description to explain to the user why it is disabled.
