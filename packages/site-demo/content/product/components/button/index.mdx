# Button

**Buttons trigger actions with a single click.**

## High emphasis

Use high emphasis to help users to identify the main action.
There should not be more than one high emphasis button in a view.

## Medium emphasis

Use medium emphasis for secondary actions.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="emphasis-medium" withThemeSwitcher />

### Toggled button

Medium button have an extra option: `isSelected`. Use `isSelected` for toggleable actions like notification activation, or feed subscribtion. Make sure to describe as much as possible actions with the buttons labels.

## Low emphasis

When the view contains a primary and a medium button, use low emphasis for lower priority actions.
Alternatively, use low emphasis when there is only one level of priority.

## Small size

Use small size when space is a constraint.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo="small" withThemeSwitcher />

## Full width

Use full width when you need to get the button full width.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo="full-width" withThemeSwitcher />
