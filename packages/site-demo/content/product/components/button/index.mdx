# Button

**Buttons trigger actions with a single click.**

## High emphasis

Use high emphasis to help users to identify the main action.
There should not be more than one high emphasis button in a view.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="emphasis-high" withThemeSwitcher />

## Medium emphasis

Use medium emphasis for secondary actions.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="emphasis-medium" withThemeSwitcher />

### Toggled button

Medium button have an extra option: `isSelected`. Use `isSelected` for toggleable actions like notification activation, or feed subscription. Make sure to describe as much as possible actions with the buttons labels.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="toggle" withThemeSwitcher />

## Low emphasis

When the view contains a primary and a medium button, use low emphasis for lower priority actions.
Alternatively, use low emphasis when there is only one level of priority.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="emphasis-low" withThemeSwitcher />

## Small size

Use small size when space is a constraint.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo="small" withThemeSwitcher />

## Full width

Use full width when you need to get the button full width.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo="full-width" withThemeSwitcher />

### Accessibility concerns

#### Button

Button will use the text within the button as the accessible name, if there is no text in it (replaced by an image, an icon, etc ...) then you **should pass an `aria-label`** describing what the button does.

Buttons may have 3 specific accessibility use cases:

- **Button as a link** if you set the `linkAs` or the `href` prop, then your button will use the `<a>` tag.
In this case, the label of the button (or `aria-label`) will be enough to make your link accessible.
- **Toggle button**, when your button as an active/inactive state (`isSelected` prop is responsible of this state). 
If the label of the button **changes depending on the state, then it doesn't need anything more.**
But if the label of the button **doesn't change you should add a `aria-pressed=true/false`** to specify to the user in which state the button is.
 - **Menu button** if your button opens a dropdown. 
 You have to set, on the button, `aria-haspopup` to `true`, and `aria-expanded` to `true` when the dropdown is open.
 Also, when the dropdown is open, you have to add `aria-controls` on the button, referencing the id of the dropdown. If your dropdown is not present in the DOM when it is closed, then you should not provide the `aria-controls` prop.

#### IconButton

All concerns about the `Button` component are true for `IconButton`, but as there is no text in the button, you have to provide a `label` describing what the button does.
