# Button

**Buttons trigger actions with a single click.**

## High emphasis

Use high emphasis to help users to identify the main action.
There should not be more than one high emphasis button in a view.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo1, vue: VueDemo1 }} />

## Medium emphasis

Use medium emphasis for secondary actions.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo2, vue: VueDemo2 }} />

### Toggled button

Medium button have an extra option: `isSelected`. Use `isSelected` for toggleable actions like notification activation, or feed subscription. Make sure to describe as much as possible actions with the buttons labels.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo3, vue: VueDemo3 }} />

## Low emphasis

When the view contains a primary and a medium button, use low emphasis for lower priority actions.
Alternatively, use low emphasis when there is only one level of priority.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo4, vue: VueDemo4 }} />

## Small size

Use small size when space is a constraint.

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo5, vue: VueDemo5 }} />

## Full width

Use full width when you need to get the button full width.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: ReactDemo6, vue: VueDemo6 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

#### Button

Button will use the text within the button as the accessible name, if there is no text in it (replaced by an image, an icon, etc ...) then you **should pass an `aria-label`** describing what the button does.

Buttons may have 3 specific accessibility use cases:

-   **Button as a link** if you set the `linkAs` or the `href` prop, then your button will use the `<a>` tag.
    In this case, the label of the button (or `aria-label`) will be enough to make your link accessible.
-   **Toggle button**, when your button as an active/inactive state (`isSelected` prop is responsible of this state).
    If the label of the button **changes depending on the state, then it doesn't need anything more.**
    But if the label of the button **doesn't change you should add a `aria-pressed=true/false`** to specify to the user in which state the button is.
-   **Menu button** if your button opens a dropdown.
    You have to set, on the button, `aria-haspopup` to `true`, and `aria-expanded` to `true` when the dropdown is open.
    Also, when the dropdown is open, you have to add `aria-controls` on the button, referencing the id of the dropdown. If your dropdown is not present in the DOM when it is closed, then you should not provide the `aria-controls` prop.

#### IconButton

All concerns about the `Button` component are true for `IconButton`, but as there is no text in the button, you have to provide a `label` describing what the button does.
