# Notification

**Notifications provide messages about app processes at the bottom right of the screen.**

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" hasPlayButton demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Notifications use the ARIA `alert` role which will announce itself when it appears.

Clickable notifications (or containing clickable action button) are not easily accessible with the keyboard. Consider moving the focus to the clickable elements and restore the focus to the previous place when the notification is closed.

### Properties

<PropTable component="Notification" />
