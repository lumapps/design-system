# Checkbox

**Checkboxes allow users to select none, one, or more items.**

### Accessibility concerns

Checkboxes with label are fully accessible by default. If a helper is provided, it will be used as an additional [description for screen readers](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-describedby).

In contexts where there is no direct label attached to the checkbox, alternative label should be provided with either [`aria-labelledby`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) (preferred) or [`aria-label`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label) (only in last resort) attributes forwarded inside the `inputProps` property.

Checkbox can be disabled in two ways:
- `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the checkbox. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click,
  etc.) are all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the checkbox is here and why it
  is disabled.
- `aria-disabled` only disable changes on the checkbox (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
  to setup either a `helper`, a tooltip or an aria description to explain to the user why it is disabled.
