# Link preview

**Link previews display an hyperlink related info and image.**

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Big size

Use `big` size to give more emphasis to the displayed hyperlink, make sure to have a good quality image.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Link previews use a standard `article` HTML element making it a self-contained section in which the link preview title is the heading (use `titleHeading` to customize its level).
The thumbnail, title and link are all clickable but on keyboard focus navigation, only one element is accessible, either the title (if present) or the full link.

### Properties
