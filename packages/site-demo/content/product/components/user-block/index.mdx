# User block

**User blocks display user info.**

## Sizes

User blocks come in four sizes: `xs`, `s`, `m`, and `l`.
Check [size foundations](/product/foundations/size) for more details.

### Extra Small

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

### Small

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

### Medium

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

### Large

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo4 }} />

## Layouts

There are two orientation: `horizontal` and `vertical`.

### Vertical

A `l` size user block is needed for `vertical` orientation.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo5 }} />

### Extended

The `vertical` orientation displays additional contact actions and a follow button.
When there are more than five contact actions, the fifth is replaced with an overflow menu presenting remaining actions.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo6 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

User blocks can be clickable if provided with `onClick` or `linkProps` or `linkAs` props:

-   `onClick` will use buttons on the avatar and name elements
-   `linkProps` or `linkAs` will use links on the avatar and name elements

Between the avatar and the name, only the name is accessible on keyboard navigation to avoid redundancy since both
replicate the same link or button. You should set the `aria-label` on the name element (via the `nameProps`) to properly
describe the button action or the link target.

See the [button page](../button#accessibility-concerns) for the accessibility concerns on actions button.
