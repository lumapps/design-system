# User block <ReactStabilityFlag status="unstable" />

**User blocks display user info.**

## Sizes

User blocks come in three sizes: `s`, `m`, and `l`.
Check [size design tokens](/product/design-tokens/size) for more details.

### Small

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="size-s" withThemeSwitcher />

### Medium

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="size-m" withThemeSwitcher />

### Large

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="size-l" withThemeSwitcher />

## Layouts

There are two orientation: `horizontal` and `vertical`.

### Vertical

A `l` size user block is needed for `vertical` orientation.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="vertical" withThemeSwitcher />

### Extended

The `vertical` orientation displays additional contact actions and a follow button.
When there are more than five contact actions, the fifth is replaced with an overflow menu presenting remaining actions.
