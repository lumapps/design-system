**User blocks display user info.**

## Sizes

User blocks come in three sizes: _small_, _medium_, and _large_.

### Small

### Large

## Layouts

There are two alternative layouts: _vertical_ and _extended_.

### Vertical

A _large_ size user block can be displayed vertically.

### Extended

The extended layout displays additional contact actions and a follow button.
When there are more than five contact actions, the fifth is replaced with an overflow menu presenting remaining actions.
