# Text field <ReactStabilityFlag status="unstable" />

**Text fields are simple text inputs.**

<DemoBlock demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Special states

There are three special states: `isDisabled`, `isValid`, and `hasError`.

### Is disabled

Use `isDisabled` when values can't be edited.

<DemoBlock demo="disabled" withThemeSwitcher />

### Is valid

Use `isValid` to tell that entered values are considered correct.

<DemoBlock demo="valid" withThemeSwitcher />

### Has error

Use `hasError` to tell that entered values are considered incorrect.

<DemoBlock demo="invalid" withThemeSwitcher />

## Options

There are seven options: `isRequired`, `helper`, `placeholder`, `icon`, `clearButtonProps`, `maxLength` and `chips`.

### Is required

Use `isRequired` to tell that the text field must be filled to submit the form.

<DemoBlock demo="required" withThemeSwitcher />

### Helper

Use `helper` to provide gidance.

### Placeholder

Use `placeholder` to give an example of expected values or invite filling text fields.

<DemoBlock demo="placeholder" withThemeSwitcher />

### Icon

Use `icon` to illustrate text fields `label`, `icon` complements `label` but can't replace it.

### Is clearable

To allow the user to clear the text field, you would have to pass a `label` prop through `clearButtonProps` prop. This corresponds to the label which will be used inside the tooltip of the clear icon button. Setting the label is enough to determine the visbility of the clear button. Use `onClear` to pass the function triggered by a click on the clear icon button.

### Max length

Use `maxLength` when users inputs length are limited.

### Chips

Use `chips` when users inputs need to be split in distinct parts such as tag entry.
