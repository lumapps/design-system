# Text field

**Text fields are simple text inputs.**

<DemoBlock demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Special states

There are three special states: `isDisabled`, `isValid`, and `hasError`.

### Is disabled

Use `isDisabled` when values can't be edited.

<DemoBlock demo="disabled" withThemeSwitcher />

### Is valid

Use `isValid` to tell that entered values are considered correct.

<DemoBlock demo="valid" withThemeSwitcher />

### Has error

Use `hasError` to tell that entered values are considered incorrect.

<DemoBlock demo="invalid" withThemeSwitcher />

## Options

There are seven options: `isRequired`, `helper`, `placeholder`, `icon`, `clearButtonProps`, `maxLength` and `chips`.

### Is required

Use `isRequired` to tell that the text field must be filled to submit the form.

<DemoBlock demo="required" withThemeSwitcher />

### Helper

Use `helper` to provide guidance.

<DemoBlock demo="helper" withThemeSwitcher />

### Placeholder

Use `placeholder` to give an example of expected values or invite filling text fields.

<DemoBlock demo="placeholder" withThemeSwitcher />

### Icon

Use `icon` to illustrate text fields `label`, `icon` complements `label` but can't replace it.

### Is clearable

To allow the user to clear the text field, you would have to pass a `label` prop through `clearButtonProps` prop. This corresponds to the label which will be used inside the tooltip of the clear icon button. Setting the label is enough to determine the visibility of the clear button. Use `onClear` to pass the function triggered by a click on the clear icon button.

### Max length

Use `maxLength` when users inputs length are limited.

### Chips

Use `chips` when users inputs need to be split in distinct parts such as tag entry.

## Textarea

Use Text areas when users are expected to enter more than one line of text.

<DemoBlock demo="text-area" withThemeSwitcher />

### Valid

<DemoBlock demo="text-area-valid" withThemeSwitcher />

### Invalid

<DemoBlock demo="text-area-invalid" withThemeSwitcher />

## Number

Use number input when users are expected to enter numeric values.

### Accessibility concerns

TextFields use standard HTML input or textarea (when using multiline).

Make sure to always properly label them with the builtin `label` or attaching external labels (via `aria-labelledby`, or
 external HTML `label` with `for`).

Showing a text field with only a placeholder is not sufficient, visual and accessible labels must also be in place.

Text fields can be disabled in two ways:
- `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the text field. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click, etc.) are
  all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the field is here and why it is disabled.
- `aria-disabled` only disable editing the text field (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
  to setup either a `helper`, a tooltip or an aria description to explain to the user why this field is disabled.
