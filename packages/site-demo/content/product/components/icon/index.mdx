# Icon

**Icons are small visual representations of common actions, objects or ideas.**\
They help users to identify information and provide context.\
Check the [icon library](/product/foundations/iconography/#library) for a searchable list of all our icons.

## Sizes

Comes in 6 sizes: `xxs`, `xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `xl`.
Check [size foundations](/product/foundations/size) for more details.

## Typology

### Simple

Display a raw icon. Often used nested in other components.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1, vue: VueDemo1 }} />

### Shape

Display an icon with a shape. Often used as small illustrations.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2, vue: VueDemo2 }} />

## Colors

Colors available: `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `red`, `dark` and `light`.
`blue` is often used as an accent visual, `green` to emphasize success, `yellow` to emphasize warnings, `red` to emphasize alerts and `dark` or `light` as a neutral visual.
See [foundation colors](/product/foundations/color) for more details.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo3, vue: VueDemo3 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

By default, icons are hidden from screen reader as they are generally decoration and do not convey information.

The `alt` property can be used make it appear as an image with alternate text in screen readers.

### Properties

<PropTable component="Icon" />
