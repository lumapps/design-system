# ImageLightbox

**Reveals an image or image slideshow after clicking on a trigger.**

The image lightbox component is a composition of the [Lightbox](/product/components/lightbox/) and a [Slideshow](/product/components/slideshow/) with extra features (zoom & better a11y defaults).

<DemoBlock vAlign="center" demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

All accessibility concern around focus management are handled by the `ImageLightbox.useImageLightbox()` hook as long as you properly attach the trigger props (see demo code).

As this component is composed of a dialog and many action button, you must provide:

-   A label via either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` props to name the dialog (ex: "Fullscreen image").
    Setting `aria-labelledby` is recommended as it target a visible label rather than adding an invisible `aria-label` on the dialog.

-   A label for the close button via `closeButtonProps` (see demo code).

-   Labels for the slideshow controls via `slideshowControlsProps` (see demo code).

-   Labels for the zoom buttons via `zoomInButtonProps`and `zoomOutButtonProps` (see demo code).
