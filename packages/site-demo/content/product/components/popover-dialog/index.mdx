# Popover dialog

**Popover dialogs are [Popovers](/product/components/popover) with a [dialog accessibility pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/dialog-modal/dialog.html) applied to it.**

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="default" />

### Accessibility concerns

This component should be used when popovers contains complex content with multiple interactive elements.

As this component uses the `dialog` accessible pattern, a few specific behaviors are applied:

- When the popover is opened, focus will be set on either the element set using the `focusElement` prop or the first focusable element.
Once the focus is set within the popover, it will be trapped and stay within the popover until it is closed.

- A label must be defined using either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` props.
  Setting `aria-labelledby` is recommended as it target a visible label rather than adding an invisible `aria-label` on the dialog.

- The activating element should take focus on popover close (`focusAnchorOnClose` property, activated by default)
