# Progress

**Progress notify user that an action is being completed.**
Progress come in two styles: `circular` and `linear`.

## Circular

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="circular" withThemeSwitcher />

## Linear

<DemoBlock demo="linear" withThemeSwitcher />

### Accessibility concerns

Progress elements are purely visual and do not use any special accessibility or landmark role.

Please look into ARIA live regions to announce the loading state and changes to the user.

### Progress circular properties

<PropTable component="ProgressCircular" />

### Progress linear properties

<PropTable component="ProgressLinear" />
