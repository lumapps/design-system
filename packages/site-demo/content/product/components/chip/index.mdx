# Chip

**Chips display distinct inputs, attributes, or actions.**

## Default

Use default to display distinct attributes such as tags on a blog post.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Dismissible

Use dismissible when chips can be removed by users.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

## Choice

Use choice when users make an exclusive choice between values. When space is not a constraint, use this chip instead of a select component.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

## Filter

Use filter as an entry point to one or several choices. When it is active, it can have a clear button.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo4 }} />

## Small

Use small when space is a constraint, as in areas like text fields, selects, dropdown menus and metadata.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo5 }} />

## Chip Group

Use chip groups to group chips together. Groups give chips responsive behavior.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo6 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Chips can be disabled in two ways:

-   `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the chip. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click,
    etc.) are all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the chip is here and why it
    is disabled.
-   `aria-disabled` only disable changes on the chip (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
    to setup either a tooltip or an aria description (must be visible too) to explain to the user why it is disabled.
