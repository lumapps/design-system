# Chip <ReactStabilityFlag status="stable" />

**Chips display distinct inputs, attributes, or actions.**

## Default

Use default to display distinct attributes such as tags on a blog post.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Dismissible

Use dismissible when chips can be removed by users.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="dismissible" withThemeSwitcher />

## Choice

Use choice when users makes an exclusive choice between values. When space is not a constraint, use this chip instead of a select component.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="choice" withThemeSwitcher />

## Filter

Use filter as an entry point to one or several choices. When it is active, it can have a clear button.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="filter" withThemeSwitcher />

## Small

Use small when space is a constraint, as in areas like text fields, selects, dropdown menus and metadata.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="small" withThemeSwitcher />

## Chip Group

Use chip groups to group chips together. Groups give chips responsive behavior.
