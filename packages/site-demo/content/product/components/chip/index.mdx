# Chip

**Chips display distinct inputs, attributes, or actions.**

## Default

Use default to display distinct attributes such as tags on a blog post.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="default" withThemeSwitcher />

## Dismissible

Use dismissible when chips can be removed by users.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="dismissible" withThemeSwitcher />

## Choice

Use choice when users make an exclusive choice between values. When space is not a constraint, use this chip instead of a select component.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="choice" withThemeSwitcher />

## Filter

Use filter as an entry point to one or several choices. When it is active, it can have a clear button.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="filter" withThemeSwitcher />

## Small

Use small when space is a constraint, as in areas like text fields, selects, dropdown menus and metadata.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="small" withThemeSwitcher />

## Chip Group

Use chip groups to group chips together. Groups give chips responsive behavior.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="group" withThemeSwitcher />

### Accessibility concerns

Chips can be disabled in two ways:
- `disabled`/`isDisabled` which completely disables the chip. It's not focusable and pointer events (hover, click,
  etc.) are all disabled too. You'll have to find another way to indicate to users that the chip is here and why it
  is disabled.
- `aria-disabled` only disable changes on the chip (read only) so it's still focusable and accessible. You'll have
  to setup either a tooltip or an aria description (must be visible too) to explain to the user why it is disabled.
