# Comment block

**Comment blocks display rich text messages as comments or chat messages.**

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Relevant

Use relevant comment block for validated messages as an accepted answer to a question.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

## Threaded

Use threaded comment block to show relation between several messages as replies.

<DemoBlock withThemeSwitcher demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Comment blocks and it's default subcomponents do not use any special landmark or accessibility role.

Avoid using the deprecated `onClick`, `onMouseEnter` & `onMouseLeave` props as they do not provide accessible interactive elements.

### Properties
