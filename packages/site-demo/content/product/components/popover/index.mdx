# Popover

**Popovers display pieces of UI on top of others. They are positioned using anchor elements.**

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="default" />

## Positions

### Directed

Popovers can be placed to 4 positions: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`

<DemoBlock demo="positions" />

### Auto

Popovers can also be placed automatically where space is available. They are placed at the bottom of anchors by default.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="auto" />

## Offset

Popovers position can have an offset.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo="offset" />

## Alignments

In addition to positions, popovers can be aligned to a chosen anchor's side:
`top-start`, `top-end`, `right-start`, `right-end`, `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`, `left-start`, `left-end`, `auto-start`, `auto-end`.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo="alignments" />

## Matching width

Popovers width can be forced to match anchors.

<DemoBlock demo="matching-width" />

### Accessibility concerns

Popovers do not come with turnkey accessibility behavior as they can be used in multiple use cases.

#### Disclosure

Popovers can be used to disclose information by activating a button.

To apply this pattern, the following concerns should be handled:

- The activating element should have the `aria-expanded` ([see W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-expanded) for detail usage)
- The popover should not take focus on open (`focusElement` property should be left blank)
- The popover should appear after the activating element in the tab order (`usePortal` property should be set to `false`)
- The popover should be closable using the escape key (`closeOnEscape` property, activated by default)
- The activating element should take focus on popover close (`focusAnchorOnClose` property, activated by default)

Examples of this pattern can be found on the WAI-ARIA [disclosure pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).

#### Popup

Popovers can be used as "popup" containing other accessibility pattern inside (menu, listbox, etc. See [W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-haspopup) for the full list).

In all of those cases, the following concerns should be handled:

- The activating element should have the `aria-haspopup` ([see W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-haspopup) for detail usage)
- The popover should take focus on open (`focusElement` property should be filled)
- The popover should be closable using the escape key (`closeOnEscape` property, activated by default)
- The activating element should take focus on popover close (`focusAnchorOnClose` property, activated by default)

Examples of this pattern can be found on the WAI-ARIA [combobox pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/), [menu pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu/) or [dialog pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/).
