# Popover

**Popovers display pieces of UI on top of others. They are positioned using anchor elements.**

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo1 }} />

## Positions

### Directed

Popovers can be placed to 4 positions: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: Demo2 }} />

### Auto

Popovers can also be placed automatically where space is available. They are placed at the bottom of anchors by default.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo3 }} />

## Offset

Popovers position can have an offset.

<DemoBlock orientation="horizontal" demo={{ react: Demo4 }} />

## Alignments

In addition to positions, popovers can be aligned to a chosen anchor's side:
`top-start`, `top-end`, `right-start`, `right-end`, `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`, `left-start`, `left-end`, `auto-start`, `auto-end`.

<DemoBlock orientation="vertical" demo={{ react: Demo5 }} />

## Matching width

Popovers width can be forced to match anchors.

<DemoBlock demo={{ react: Demo6 }} />

### Accessibility concerns

Popovers do not come with turnkey accessibility behavior as they can be used in multiple use cases.

#### Disclosure

Popovers can be used to disclose information by activating a button.

To apply this pattern, the following concerns should be handled:

-   The activating element should have the `aria-expanded` ([see W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-expanded) for detail usage)
-   The popover should not take focus on open (`focusElement` property should be left blank)
-   The popover should appear after the activating element in the tab order (`usePortal` property should be set to `false`)
-   The popover should be closable using the escape key (`closeOnEscape` property, activated by default)
-   The activating element should take focus on popover close (`focusAnchorOnClose` property, activated by default)

Examples of this pattern can be found on the WAI-ARIA [disclosure pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).

#### Popup

Popovers can be used as "popup" containing other accessibility pattern inside (menu, listbox, etc. See [W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-haspopup) for the full list).

In all of those cases, the following concerns should be handled:

-   The activating element should have the `aria-haspopup` ([see W3C documentation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-haspopup) for detail usage)
-   The popover should take focus on open (`focusElement` property should be filled)
-   The popover should be closable using the escape key (`closeOnEscape` property, activated by default)
-   The activating element should take focus on popover close (`focusAnchorOnClose` property, activated by default)

Examples of this pattern can be found on the WAI-ARIA [combobox pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/), [menu pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu/) or [dialog pattern documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/).

#### Dialog

Popovers can be used as "dialogs" containing any complex pattern inside.

In this case, the following concerns should be handled:

-   Follow the sames rules as described in the [popup section](/product/components/popover#popup)
-   Use the [PopoverDialog](/product/component/popover-dialog) component to apply the correct role and pattern to the popover

### Properties
