-   Added `typography` prop to `Link` component.
-   Added `TabProvider` component wrapping the new `TabList` and `TabPanel` and handling state (controlled or uncontrolled).
-   Added `TabPanel` component that wraps the content of a tab (previously wrapped in the `Tab` component). Implements the [WAI-ARIA `tabpanel` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html#rps_label).
-   Added `TabList` component that wraps `Tab` components. Implements the [WAI-ARIA `tablist` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html#rps_label).

-   Added `isDisabled` prop to `ProgressTrackerStep` component.
-   Added `rightIcon` and `leftIcon` props for `Link` component. Sizes of icons are based on `typography` prop.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added required `label` prop for `IconButton`. The label is used as `aria-label`Â for the button and to add a tooltip. This prop is required for a11y purpose. If you really don't want a tooltip, you can give an empty label (this is not recommended).
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added `nextButtonProps` and `previousButtonProps` props to `DatePickerControlled`, `DatePicker` and `DatePickerField` components to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to change month. These fields are **required** because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added `nextButtonProps` and `previousButtonProps` props to `SlideshowControls` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to change image. These fields are **required** because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   Added `slideshowControlsProps` to the `Slideshow` component to allow setting custom props to the slideshow controls. Controls are not displayed if this prop is not set.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added `toggleButtonProps` prop to `ExpansionPanel` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to toggle the panel. This field is **required** because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added `toggleButtonProps` prop to `SideNavigationItem` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to toggle the menu. This field is **required** because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   Added `clearButtonProps` prop to `Select` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to clear the select. This prop is not required since the icon button is not automatically displayed. However, when used to display the button, the `label` prop inside the `clearButtonProps` prop will be required because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   Added `clearButtonProps` prop to `TextField` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to clear the field. This prop is not required since the icon button is not automatically displayed. However, when used to display the button, the `label` prop inside the `clearButtonProps` prop will be required because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   Added `closeButtonProps` prop to `Lightbox` component to allow setting custom props to the `IconButton`s used to close the lightbox. This prop is not required since the icon button is not automatically displayed. However, when used to display the button, the `label` prop inside the `closeButtonProps` prop will be required because translation are not handled inside the Design System and the `IconButton` now requires a `label` for a11y purposes.
-   Added `tooltipProps` to `IconButton` to allow setting custom props to the tooltip.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Added `htmlFor` prop required for `InputLabel` since it is required for `<label>` for a11y purposes.

### Changed

-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `url` prop to `link` for `LinkPreview` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `onToggle` prop to `onChange` for `Switch` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `avatar` prop from `UserBlock` component is now a string and corresponds to the avatar url. Any other avatar props should be passed to `avatarProps` prop.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `handleClick` prop to `onClick` and `actionCallback` prop to `onActionClick` for `Notification` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `closeCallback`, `openCallback` and `toggleCallback` props respectively to `onClose`, `onOpen` and `onToggleOpen` for `ExpansionPanel` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `Checkbox` now uses `checked` (edit: and its alias `isChecked`, see below) prop instead of `value` prop to know whether it is toggled on or not. This is more consistant with HTML native naming convention and this is also how it is used for `RadioButton` and `Switch`. As said above, `value` has been added as prop and acts like the HTML native prop `value`.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Changed `onChange` method signature for `RadioButton` component. This is breaking since now the `value` argument of `onChange` method is required.
-   Changed `onChange` method signature for `Switch`, `CheckBox`, `Autocomplete`, `TextField`, `DatePicker` and `Slider` components.
-   `isDisabled` prop is now the official name for the disabled state of all components (although `disabled` will also work for compatibility with the HTML `disabled` attribute)
-   `isChecked` prop is now the official name for the checked state of all checkable components (although `checked` will also work for compatibility with the HTML `checked` attribute).
-   _[BREAKING]_ The prop `value` of `TextField` component can not be a `number` anymore. The user would have to cast the value on its side.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `hideMinMaxlabel` prop to `hideMinMaxLabel` for `Slider` component.
-   Default color of `Badge` is now `primary`.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `Tab` component doesn't wrap the tab content anymore (use `TabPanel` for that). Implements the [WAI-ARIA `tab` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html#rps_label).
-   _[BREAKING]_ `onClick` prop for `Mosaic.thumbnail` prop is no longer automatically passing the index.
-   `ProgressTracker` component now implements the [WAI-ARIA `tablist` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html#rps_label).
-   _[BREAKING]_ `activeStep` prop for `ProgressTracker` component has been removed and is now handled by `ProgressTrackerProvider` component.
-   `ProgressTrackerStep` components are button instead of anchor for better a11y. Aria attributes have been added according to [WAI ARIA `tab` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html) since stepper are similar to tabs in term of a11y.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `onClick` prop for `ProgressTrackerStep` component is not used anymore. `ProgressTrackerProvider` component has an `onChange` prop instead. Therefore, a step is now clickable if it is not disabled.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `DatePicker` and `DatePickerField` `value` prop can no longer be a `Moment` object. This will allow us to remove `moment` dep in the future without generating breaking change later. The `value` prop can no longer be a `string` to avoid handling incompatible values. `value` can only be a `Date` (or `undefined` for non selectable values).
-   _[BREAKING]_ Thumbnail `loading` prop now take `eager` or `lazy` string (instead of enum).
-   _[BREAKING]_ `@lumx/react` is now exported as an ESM module targeting the [browserlist `defaults` query](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list). The package is not compatible with IE anymore. You can keep the compatibility by configuring your own polyfills and/or transpilation in your build setup.
-   _[BREAKING]_ `lodash` is now defined as a `peerDependencies`. You must install them separately from the `@lumx/react` package.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `buttonRef` by `ref` in `Button` and `IconButton` components.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `buttonGroupRef` by `ref` in `ButtonGroup` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `chipRef` by `ref` in `Chip` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `iconRef` by `ref` in `Icon` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `linkRef` by `ref` in `Link` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `listElementRef` by `ref` in `List` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `popoverRef` by `ref` in `Popover` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Replaced `userBlockRef` by `ref` in `UserBlock` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ The alternative text is now required (`alt` prop in `Thumbnail`, `thumbnails[].alt` in `Mosaic`, `alt` in `ImageBlock`, `thumbnailProps.alt` in `PostBlock`, `thumbnailProps.alt` in `LinkPreview`, `alt` in `Avatar`, `avatarProps.alt` in `CommentBlock` and `avatarProps.alt` in `userBlock`).
-   _[BREAKING]_ The title is now required in `ImageBlock`.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Reworked Thumbnail CORS default. `crossOrigin` now default to `undefined` instead of `'anonymous'`. `isCrossOriginEnabled` prop was removed (use `crossOrigin={undefined}` instead).
-   _[BREAKING]_ Upgrade to mdi v5.8.55 and handle backward compatibility (see [details]([./packages/lumx-icons/README-v4-to-v5-migration.md])).
-   `Avatar` component now uses `Thumbnail` component.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Since `alt` in now required for `Avatar`, `avatar` and `avatarProps` props have been merged into `avatarProps` for both `CommentBlock` and `UserBlock`.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Removed `ListItemSize` (use `Size` instead), `TabListPosition` (use `Alignment` instead), `SwitchPosition` (use `Alignment` instead), `ThScope` (was not used).
-   _[BREAKING]_ Renamed `Kind.valid` into `Kind.success` and removed `MessageKind` and `NotificationType` (use `Kind` instead).
-   Loosened enum type so you can use the string value instead (ex: you can use `'s'` instead of `Size.s`).

### Removed

-   _[BREAKING]_ Removed `HTMLElement` as type in `PostBlock` component props.
-   _[BREAKING]_ Removed `onOpen` prop from `Dialog` component. User should use `isOpen` from its side.
